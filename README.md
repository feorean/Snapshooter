# Snapshooter

This app was created for Macs and published in Apple AppStore in 2016 
I made it available for free for one year. 

I have removed it from AppStore and now publishing it for public. So, it might inspire someone... :)

Code:
 - Is written in Objective-C

Features: 
 - It takes your work activity as a snapshots and save them in the local drive. 
 - When you need to go back in time and find what you were doing at particular moment or watching a video etc. then it makes it easy to do it
